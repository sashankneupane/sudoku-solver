# Sudoku Solver
It solves M X N soduku problem if all it's subsizes are of same dimension.

I tried to solve the problem by hardcoding, but the resulting script "hardcoded.py" could only solve easy 3 by 3 sudoku program. However, "backpropsolver.py" can solve any sudoku problems of reasonable size at lightning speed.

## To-dos
- make the script more efficient
- write a sudoku problem generator script
- probably add some GUI in the future
