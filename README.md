# Sudoku Solver
It solves manually input sudoku problems. For now, it can only solve 3 by 3 problems. 

I devised this own method. I don't know if it already exists out there, but I tried to tackle this problem without referring to any other resources in the web, and I am happy I was able to write a functioning script. Now that I have created it by myself, I will look into other's methods and try to maximize my program's efficiency.

## How it works
This program just receives input from the user and computes possible results for each numberholder in the sudoku problem. When a placeholder has only one possible result, it replaces the original nested list with that number. 



## To-dos
- Make this program able to handle any kind of errors from user's end
- Make the program scalable, at least up to 4 by 4
- Make a GUI for the program 
- Increase efficiency of the program
