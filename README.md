# Sudoku Solver
It solves manually input sudoku problems. For now, it can only solve easy 3 by 3 problems. 

I hardcoded this program, so it cannot tackle complex problems. I am currently working on maximizing this program's efficiency.

## How it works
This program just receives input from the user and computes possible results for each numberholder in the sudoku problem. When a placeholder has only one possible result, it replaces the original nested list with that number. 



## To-dos
- make this program scalable and more efficient
